# TypeSatePattern in F#

Inspired by the TypeStatePattern in Rust, I made a small demo for myself to see how it would work in another functional language like F#. This obciously isnt as clean as Rust due to the lack of move semantics making, but it was still nice to see how it would work with no state data stored in the actual object
